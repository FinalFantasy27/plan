Peirce's work and notations were much better known to contemporary logicians, and we had to wait for Russell to reintroduce Frege's first ‘discovery’ of quantifiers (Putnam 1982). For example, Ernst Schröder's Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik (1895) adopted Peirce's notation. Hence, strictly speaking, the Frege-first view seems to be a more recent phenomenon than Peirce's/Frege's era.

“ce".We know that this assertion, this exchange of letters, was known to Husserl, because Husserl had made excerpts from the correspondence, which entail just this part of the dispute.But not only this.Husserl also added the remark: "Frege does not understand the sense (Sinn) of Hilbert's 'axiomatic' foundation of geometry.”

"And it is not easily squared with the fact that during his philosophically most productive period, Russell used the terminology only to express his agreement with Kant that mathematics is synthetic, while holding that, contrary to Kant, logic is as synthetic as mathematics.

There is also the issue of the Kleene-Rosser paradox (or its simpliﬁed version called Curry’s paradox), which shows that untyped lambda calculus is inconsistent; but a little inconsistency never stopped a programming language from being widely accepted.(Programming with haskell, p26, footnote 4)

“一、数学跟逻辑分了家。数学只在逻辑之上而不在逻辑之内，可以有不在逻 辑中定义的数学概念、不在逻辑中证明的数学原理。“大数学”集合论取代了“大逻辑”PM。”康宏逵《王浩来信摘抄》

In RobertVaught’s valuable survey (1974) of model theory before 1945, he points out that Skolem,for example, worked comfortably with the notion of truth in a model, though--by contrast--uncertainly with the notion of proof, and the latter is a principal reason that he missed 10establishing the completeness theorem for first-order logic.

More generally, according to Vaught (op.cit., p.161), since the notion of truth of a first-order sentence σ in a structure delta “is highly intuitive (and perfectly clear for any definite σ), it had been possible to go even as far as the completeness theorem by treating truth (consciously or unconsciously)essentially as an undefined notion--one with many obvious properties.” Even Tarski, asquoted in ftn.5 above, from (1931), agreed with that.

Wilfrid Hodges, “Truth in a structure” (1985/86), which beginswith an informal explanation of the current conception.Hodges then goes on to report (p.137) that:

[a] few years ago I had a disconcerting experience.I read Tarski’s famousmonograph ‘The concept of truth in formalized languages’ (1935) to see what hesays himself about the notion of truth in a structure.The notion was simply notthere.This seemed curious, so I looked in other papers of Tarski.As far as Icould discover, the notion first appears in Tarski’s address (1952) to the 1950International Congress of Mathematicians, and his paper ‘Contributions to thetheory of models I’ (1954).But even in those papers he doesn’t define it.In thefirst paper he mentions the notion only in order to explain that he won’t be needingit for the purpose in hand.In the second paper he simply says “We assume it to be clear under what conditions a sentence is satisfied in a system.”

Hodges continues, “I believe that the first time Tarski explicitly presented the mathematicaldefinition of truth in a structure was his joint paper (1957) with Robert Vaught.” In fact,the general notion of structure for a first-order language L is already described in Tarski’s1950 ICM address, essentially as follows: a structure A is a sequence consisting of a non-empty domain A of objects together with an assignment to each basic relation, operationand constant symbol of L of a corresponding relation between elements of A, operation onelements of A, or member of A, resp.Moreover, while Hodges is correct in saying thatthe notion of truth in a structure is not defined there, Tarski does talk of the antecedentnotion of satisfaction in a structure as if it is well understood, since he refers to the association with each formula ϕ of the set of all sequences from A which satisfy ϕ in A 

At any rate, what is of interest, as Hodges makes clear, is that these notions of structure, and of satisfaction and truth in a structure, do not seem to appear explicitly priorto the 1950s in Tarski’s work.This is doubly puzzling, since, as a common informalnotion, the idea of a structure being a model of a system of axioms well precedes that, andsurely goes back to the nineteenth century.Most famously in that period, one had thestunning revelation of various models for non-Euclidean geometry.Then came Dedekind’s characterization of the natural numbers and the real numbers, in both cases structurally asmodels, unique up to isomorphism, of suitable (second-order) axioms.That was followedby Hilbert’s model-theoretic considerations concerning his axioms for geometry.Thestructural view of mathematics took hold in the early part of the twentieth century inalgebra, analysis and topology with the formulation of axioms for groups, rings, fields,metric spaces, normed spaces, topological spaces and so on, and with the systematicexploration of their various models.Within logic, the informal concept of model has beentraced back by Scanlan (1991) to the American “postulate theorists”, launched by work ofHuntington in 1902 and Veblen in 1904; this involved, among others the concept ofconsistency in the sense of satisfiability and that of categoricity.7 Finally, it was central tothe famous theorems of Löwenheim of 1915 and Skolem in 1920 on existence of countablemodels, and of course to Gödel’s completeness theorem published in 1930



"in order to do mathematical logic, we need a basic understanding of words over a finite alphabet. We cannot build a theory from less than that." … "exactly! We suspend our disbelief for a bit, and try to 'simulate' set theory, and then construct numbers and so on in this make-believe universe. We already assumed numbers but that was "in the real world". Two ways to think about this: If we forego any notion of "meaning", then we are not constructing numbers, just manipulating strings to get other strings. This dissolves the question.…" … https://mathoverflow.net/questions/47399/dont-the-axioms-of-set-theory-implicitly-assume-numbers

I call this the logic-metalogic link. There are two facets to the logic-metalogic link. First, when a logic is entangled with a substantive issue, the same position on that issue should be taken at the meta- level as at the object level; and second, if an expression has a clear meaning in natural language, then the corresponding concept can equally well be deployed in a formal language.

从集合论模型“内部看”和“外部看”的两个例子：
司寇伦悖论：洛文海姆-司寇伦定理告诉我们可数语言的任意有无限模型的语句集合都有可数模型；而contor定理告诉我们存在不可数的集合。
这里的要点是“可数不可数”的定义是有没有一个从该集合到自然数集上的一一映射；从这个可数模型中我们能证明没有这样的映射（有在“这个模型看来”“不可数”的集合，因为该模型只能运用自己内的资源），但是在外面的我们看来，能找到这样在那个可数模型中的“不可数”集合到自然数集的一一映射；
而哥德尔第二不完全性定理告诉我们，如果一个包含皮亚诺算术的理论a存在模型, 那么就肯定存在某个模型M, 使得M满足"a不存在模型"，或者说，有一个a+~con(a)的模型M（其中con()是表示一致性的公式）。这就是说，M中的“自然数”一定存在非标准元素. 这是因为M中有一个“自然数”k, 使得k是一个证明的编码, 这个证明的开头是ZFC的公理, 结尾是0=1. 而根据我们背景假设, 这样一个证明实际上不存在, 也就是说编码这样一个证明的k是非标准自然数。
这个证明在M自己看来是对矛盾的“证明”；可是在外面的我们看来不是。
这是在模型内部“看来”“是”，而在外面的我们看来“不是”的例子；

一个更有趣的类似的例子是“每一个ZFC的模型其中都有一个ZFC的模型”，来源zs chen：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/166055749
这是在模型内部“看来”“不是”，而在外面的我们看来“是”的一个例子；

·除了集合论中同一套数学对象可能有不同的编码——例如冯诺依曼序数和策梅洛序数，这造成了一些jargons，例如谁都不会认为0本身“确实”∈1本身（我们都会把∈理解为自然数上的序关系<）——之外，不同的数学对象却可能有同一套编码，例如作为自然数的1和作为真值的T的编码可能都是1，但是谁也不会说我们是在意指1就真的是T了，在布尔逻辑的简单的二值算术作为一个unit的T（或1），当然不是作为自然数上运算的unit的1.

·Did Hansel and Greteldrop an even number of bread crumbs or an odd number抽象世界的居民，ta们看见数就像我们看见桌子一样轻松，ta们甚至可以把数“拿”起来

·几乎大部分数学哲学家都认为自然数是直接给定的，“直觉的”，可是ta们认不认为 ω-sequence, real line, complex plane, and perhaps initial segment of the iterative hierarchy of (pure) sets是直觉的呢？这些，尤其是最后一个，几乎都是在实际的历史中给出的。

·集合论的还原是认识论上的，任何数学的知识都可以还原为逻辑和对集合论的公理作出的推论的知识，可是很多数学家在不知道任何集合论之前就已经知道了很多定理。集合论的还原不是本体论上的，也不是认识论的。只是原则上我们有这样一种认识论上的认识数学的方法（Maddy, settheoretic foundation, p3）
